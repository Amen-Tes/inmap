## inmap run steady

Run InMAP in steady-state mode.

### Synopsis


steady runs InMAP in steady-state mode to calculate annual average concentrations with no temporal variability.

```
inmap run steady
```

### Options

```
      --creategrid   Create the variable-resolution grid as specified in the configuration file before starting the simulation instead of reading it from a file. If --dynamic is set to true, then this flag will also be automatically set to true.
  -d, --dynamic      Run with a dynamic grid that changes resolution depending on spatial gradients in population density and concentration.
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --config string   configuration file location (default "./inmap.toml")
```
